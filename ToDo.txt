To Do:
-Pan and zoom for ipad. On ipad, two finger drag is pan and pinch is zoom. Zoom now works(drawtracks, engine, copy works but not caption) but need to debug pan
-when make station rotate platform 180 to avoid putting over track
-draw diagonal square in blender
-eyes and fur on bunny
-browse: add launch from thumbnail, and up down votes, and voting for online version, pagiate browse.php
-remake trx for each level
-make stations type specific
-should enable functions by having magic tunnel that train enters in one place and then exits in another place (function) then returns



Bug-
-tunnel needs to be on top. Draw last.
-greater/less than. the equal gives wrong answer. See trx 74 for example.
-bunny makes increment sound e.g. trx76

New features:
High prioirty-


-add stop, reverse, decouple stations
-add user types, and show/hide functionality based on user types- trainee=no toolbar locked on draw tracks, etc.
-need to script rendering, re-render everything at higher res
-render cargoShapes line, triangle...octagon

Low priority-
-animate stations performing their action: catapult and slignshot cargo moving, slide on off for supply, dump, pickDrop
-optimize draw(). It currently redraws everything rather than just what has changed

-SERVER

-APPS
-test on iPhone and Android

*Improvements
-optimize- might be detectingStations every iteration instead of just on entering tile.
-improve prompt switching from popup dialog to clicking on tile
-put dot in middle or in someway highlight which ec the mouse is currently over (hover using mouse move) so you can delete the right ec if near edge of tile
-add undo/redo chain-for web
-need an idiom for storing numbers >10. Like by having different cars for ones,tens, hundreds...


*To be sucessful
-gameplay needs to be good (series of trx puzzles that build skills and are fun to figure out)
-needs to be visually appealing. Good graphics and animations
-needs to not be frustrating- no bugs, intuitive interface
-needs to convince parents that it is teaching programing or math or spelling/reading
-needs to fun at wide range of levels and amount of time invested


-potential data types
--yes/no: emoji happy/sad, traffic light
--ponies
--match box cars
--stuffed animals (beanie babies)
--dinosaurs
--safari animals
--lego minifigures
--robots
