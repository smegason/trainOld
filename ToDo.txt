To Do:

Branches to make:
Upload/download tracks to train-hub.org
-from train.js allow
--new users
--login
--upload tracks
--download own tracks or other tracks
(need new icons for login/new user, upload, download)
Workflow
-when upload pushed
	-sign in dialog box if not already logged in
	-upload dialog box: track name, track description
-download
	-your tracks, search
	
Dialogs:
-new user
-login
-send password
-upload tracks
-download tracks	
	
	
Signin- username, password ->sign in  OR Join Train

Game plan for development
-change how track direction chosen
-change cursor to active icon
-add yes/no data type
-remove nonsprite code
-potential data types
--yes/no: emoji, traffic light
--ponies
--match box cars
--stuffed animals (beanie babies)
--dinosaurs
--safari animals
--lego minifigures
--robots



Bug-
-W is a hexagon? Need to re-render.
-should allow pinch zoom to different levels so can appreciate the graphics on blocks, first try just rendering bigger and then downsample. Zoom controls tile field but not button bar. Track
field is fixed at 64x64 and can pinch zoom and two finger pan 
-need to script rendering
-should enable functions by having magic tunnel that train enters in one place and then exits in another place (function) then returns
-greater/less than. the equal gives wrong answer. See trx 74 for example.
-bunny makes increment sound e.g. trx76

New features:
-add stop, reverse, decouple stations
-make all stations only work for matching type. 
-add immutable property to tracks, ecs, and cargo so can distinguish level base trx from user drawn, render in different color or different color octagon underneath
-add user types, and show/hide functionality based on user types- trainee=no toolbar locked on draw tracks, etc.

-BLENDER
	-render cargoShapes...
	-to draw: square connectors; stop, reverse, decouple station
	-animate stations performing their action: catapult and slignshot cargo moving, slide on off for supply, dump, pickDrop
	
-optimize draw(). It currently redraws everything rather than just what has changed

-SERVER
-setup server for upload and download (store trx as strings in database)
-server- create accounts, login, upload/download trx
-server- keep track of progress of user (trainee, conductor, engineer, etc.)
-server-php script to take uploaded file and put in database
-db tables: users, trx files, user types, courses


-APPS


*Bugs

-need to switch wyes after train passes or if switch after engine then ignore switch until train has passed
- doesn't crash but shouold on this trax= trx[]='[[[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,{"gridx":3,"gridy":2,"type":"TrackStraight","orientation":2,"state":"left","subtype":""},null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,{"gridx":4,"gridy":2,"type":"TrackStraight","orientation":2,"state":"left","subtype":""},null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,{"gridx":5,"gridy":2,"type":"TrackStraight","orientation":2,"state":"left","subtype":""},null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,{"gridx":6,"gridy":2,"type":"Track90","orientation":6,"state":"left","subtype":""},{"gridx":6,"gridy":3,"type":"Track90","orientation":4,"state":"left","subtype":""},null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,{"gridx":7,"gridy":2,"type":"Track90","orientation":0,"state":"left","subtype":""},{"gridx":7,"gridy":3,"type":"Track90","orientation":2,"state":"left","subtype":""},null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]],[{"gridx":3,"gridy":2,"type":"EngineBasic","orientation":2,"state":"","speed":20,"position":0.5}],[]]'

*Improvements
-optimize- might be detectingStations every iteration instead of just on entering tile.
-improve prompt switching from popup dialog to clicking on tile
-put dot in middle or in someway highlight which ec the mouse is currently over (hover using mouse move) so you can delete the right ec if near edge of tile
-should add, subt, mult, divide roll over (%) or just max/min out? or put max/min on car and remainder on station
-add zoom and pan- for web
-add undo/redo chain-for web
-need an idiom for storing numbers >10. Like by having different cars for ones,tens, hundreds...
-need a binary cargo type, maybe yes/no
-add faint tick mark to show where inset button would go on TrackStraight

-for gameplay should block 45 degree tracks until user reaches a certain level (if block 45 show square instead of octagon), and block toolbar


*To be sucessful
-gameplay needs to be good (series of trx puzzles that build skills and are fun to figure out)
-needs to be visually appealing. Good graphics and animations
-needs to not be frustrating- no bugs, intuitive interface
-needs to convince parents that it is teaching programing or math or spelling/reading
-needs to fun at wide range of levels and amount of time invested
