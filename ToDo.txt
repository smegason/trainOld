To Do:
-browse: add launch, and up down votes, and voting	

Game plan for development
-change how track direction chosen
-change cursor to active icon
-add yes/no data type
-potential data types
--yes/no: emoji, traffic light
--ponies
--match box cars
--stuffed animals (beanie babies)
--dinosaurs
--safari animals
--lego minifigures
--robots



Bug-
-greater/less than. the equal gives wrong answer. See trx 74 for example.
-bunny makes increment sound e.g. trx76

New features:
High prioirty-
-pagiate browse.php
-change how tracks are drawn-octagon vs square tracks
-should enable functions by having magic tunnel that train enters in one place and then exits in another place (function) then returns
-add stop, reverse, decouple stations
-make all stations only work for matching type. 
-add immutable property to tracks, ecs, and cargo so can distinguish level base trx from user drawn, render in different color or different color octagon underneath
-add user types, and show/hide functionality based on user types- trainee=no toolbar locked on draw tracks, etc.
-add pan and zoom using multifinger gester
-need to script rendering
-render cargoShapes line, triangle...octagon
-render cargoBinary
-render square connector instead of drawn one

Low priority-
-animate stations performing their action: catapult and slignshot cargo moving, slide on off for supply, dump, pickDrop
-optimize draw(). It currently redraws everything rather than just what has changed

-SERVER
-server- keep track of progress of user (trainee, conductor, engineer, etc.)
db tables: users, trx files, user types, courses

-APPS
-test on iPhone and Android

*Improvements
-optimize- might be detectingStations every iteration instead of just on entering tile.
-improve prompt switching from popup dialog to clicking on tile
-put dot in middle or in someway highlight which ec the mouse is currently over (hover using mouse move) so you can delete the right ec if near edge of tile
-add undo/redo chain-for web
-need an idiom for storing numbers >10. Like by having different cars for ones,tens, hundreds...

-for gameplay should block 45 degree tracks until user reaches a certain level (if block 45 show square instead of octagon), and block toolbar


*To be sucessful
-gameplay needs to be good (series of trx puzzles that build skills and are fun to figure out)
-needs to be visually appealing. Good graphics and animations
-needs to not be frustrating- no bugs, intuitive interface
-needs to convince parents that it is teaching programing or math or spelling/reading
-needs to fun at wide range of levels and amount of time invested
