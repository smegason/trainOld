To Do:
-Pan and zoom for ipad. On ipad, two finger drag is pan and pinch is zoom.
-Test browse on ipad
-convert from 2 iframes to 2 divs, run one instance of train.js, have an array of trx and associated panels (Main and thumb1, thumb2, thumb3). 
   Need to split all variables in common and instance specific--really everything but imgs.
-OR just use thumbnails in db. Would need to make thumbnail during upload process
-icon for app
-all blend files being copied to ipad app. Need to trim.
-splash screen for ipad
-always landscape on ipad


-browse: add up down votes (or just likes), and voting for online version, pagiate browse.php, add more search options (just text for all fields?)
-remake trx for each level
-secondary caption off screen
-render random wye (3 types) and caption button

Bug-
-if select cargo quickly from caption can get TypeError: imgCargo[value] is undefined[Learn More] line 2405
-copy when zoomed doesn't work
-some weird bug where can't add cargo and makes immutable
-station on diagonal straight doesn't work
-jumps track. e.g. trainee 9
-trackCargo doesn't work diagonally
-cant draw car on wye
-on move track need to copy to buffer before overwriting in case overlap
-if click toolbutton switches to immutable
-shrink trackcargo image because overlaps

New features:
High prioirty-


-add stop, reverse, decouple stations
-need to script rendering, re-render everything at higher res
-render cargoShapes line, triangle...octagon

Low priority-
-optimize draw(). It currently redraws everything rather than just what has changed

-SERVER

-APPS
-test on iPhone and Android

*Improvements
-optimize- might be detectingStations every iteration instead of just on entering tile.
-improve prompt switching from popup dialog to clicking on tile
-put dot in middle or in someway highlight which ec the mouse is currently over (hover using mouse move) so you can delete the right ec if near edge of tile
-add undo/redo chain-for web
-need an idiom for storing numbers >10. Like by having different cars for ones,tens, hundreds...
-idiom for two digit numbers- if cargo rolls over then increment next car's cargo (but backwards...)


*To be sucessful
-gameplay needs to be good (series of trx puzzles that build skills and are fun to figure out)
-needs to be visually appealing. Good graphics and animations
-needs to not be frustrating- no bugs, intuitive interface
-needs to convince parents that it is teaching programing or math or spelling/reading
-needs to fun at wide range of levels and amount of time invested


-potential data types
--yes/no: emoji happy/sad, traffic light
--ponies
--match box cars
--stuffed animals (beanie babies)
--dinosaurs
--safari animals
--lego minifigures
--robots
