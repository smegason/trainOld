To Do:

On iPad
-Pan and zoom for ipad. On ipad, two finger drag is pan and pinch is zoom.
-Test browse on ipad

Online
-browse: add up down votes (or just likes), and voting for online version, pagiate browse.php, add more search options (just text for all fields?)
-Get search/preview working


On laptop
-remake trx for each level

Bug-
-jumps track. e.g. trainee 9

Low priority-
-add stop, reverse, decouple stations
-render cargoShapes point,line, triangle...octagon

*Improvements
-idiom for two digit numbers- if cargo rolls over then increment next car's cargo (but backwards...)


*To be sucessful
-gameplay needs to be good (series of trx puzzles that build skills and are fun to figure out)
-needs to be visually appealing. Good graphics and animations
-needs to not be frustrating- no bugs, intuitive interface
-needs to convince parents that it is teaching programing or math or spelling/reading
-needs to fun at wide range of levels and amount of time invested

--yes/no: emoji happy/sad, traffic light
--ponies
--match box cars
--stuffed animals (beanie babies)
--dinosaurs
